# Overview

Princeton COS 424, Fundamentals of Machine Learning, was a class centered around Kaggle-style data science analyses. All results are reproducible with the steps described in the corresponding README of each project. Setup your python environment using `./requirements.txt` in the root directory. I am using Python 3.7.4 in a virtual environment. All files shared with these projects have been pre-approved by Professor Engelhardt.

These projects are provided to demonstrate my research and analytical abilities. I wrote them many years ago at this point, but I believe they showcase some interesting and sound techniques that laid the foundation for my later (and longer) independent research papers like my thesis in computer vision. These papers/projects grow more complex through the semester and were written in the following order:
1. Classification of Customer Reviews using Sentiment Analysis Techniques
2. Prediction of Outcomes for Children of Fragile Families
3. Netflix Genre-Based Movie Prediction
4. Inferring Movie Characteristics from Dialogue

While the first three projects were scripted, the fourth project - Inferring Movie Characteristics from Dialogue - was an independent research idea I came up with during the course. I wrote a research proposal for this idea and carried it through to a poster session and a final research paper.
